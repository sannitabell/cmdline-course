      1 young Cratchits became livid All sorts of horrors were
      1 young and old but they all played and so did Scrooge for
      1 young Act of Parliament but I mean to say you

      1 yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the
      1 years but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice
      1 year and saying Uncle Scrooge how are you If it only
      1 yawning again Left it to his company perhaps He hasnt
      1 writing be erased Deny it cried the Spirit stretching out
      1 wretched abject frightful hideous miserable They knelt
      1 wrapper from the table and bound it round its head
      1 would you seek me out and try to win me now Ah no
      1 would walk there on a Sunday My little little child
      1 wouldnt for the wealth of all the world have crushed that
      1 Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day
      1 would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a

      1 worthy place
      1 worn outside for general inspection and for Christmas daws
      1 world  This was a great relief because three days after sight
      1 world Some people laughed to see the alteration in him

      1 wonderful knockerHeres the Turkey Hallo Whoop
      1 wonder and delight with which the development of every
      1 woman whos the wiser Were not going to pick holes in
      1 woman or a child to say that he was kind to me in this
      1 woman Every person has a right to take care of themselves
      1 woman and it should have been you may depend upon it
      1 wolfish but prostrate too in their humility Where
      1 with worldly hands the light I give Is it not enough
      1 with which it was next to impossible to believe that
      1 with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and
      1 with too much getting up by candlelight and not too
      1 with too much burying fat with repleted appetite A
      1 with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed
      1 with the season or with me  May it haunt their houses
      1 with the money and even though we were not it would be
      1 with their great gold seals and so forth as Scrooge had
      1 with summer flowers But the strangest thing about it was
      1 with power to shape some picture on its surface from

      1 without resorting to the sextons spade that buried Jacob
      1 with one another and contented with the time and when
      1 with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon

      1 within its reach The very lamplighter who ran on before
      1 within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his

      1 with him
      1 with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry
      1 withered said the Ghost But she had a large heart
      1 with ease and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as
      1 with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in
      1 with Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his
      1 with a vague uncertain horror to know that behind the
      1 with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe
      1 with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares
      1 with a stake of holly through his heart He should
      1 with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed
      1 withal and he could hear the people in the court outside
      1 with a chamber in the highest story of the

      1 wisest resolution in his power
      1 wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this

      1 Will you let me in Fred
      1 Will you do me that favour
      1 will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that
      1 will not shut out the lessons that they teach Oh tell me I

      1 Whos next
      1 whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down
      1 Whose elses do you think replied the woman He
      1 wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that
      1 whole quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery
      1 whole If each smooth tile had been a blank at first
      1 who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion
      1 who had no right to express an opinion on the subject
      1 who had a book before him The mother and her daughters
      1 who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips
      1 Who are you
      1 Who and what are you Scrooge demanded
      1 white comforter dangling below his waist for he
      1 white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
      1 while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing
      1 While he did this the woman who had already spoken

      1 which was lighted cheerfully and hung with Christmas
      1 which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
      1 which though it was dumb announced itself in awful
      1 which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of
      1 which said Bob for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman
      1 which one drinks the health of such an odious stingy hard
      1 which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by

      1 Which it certainly was Admiration was the universal
      1 which he paid for the Turkey and the chuckle with which
      1 which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence and
      1 Which all the family reechoed
      1 Whether these creatures faded into mist or mist
      1 whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in
      1 where shadowy passengers passed and repassed where shadowy

      1 when the master of the house having his daughter leaning
      1 When the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up
      1 when the bell tolls One
      1 when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever
      1 when she had rallied Bob on his credulity and Bob had

      1 When it had said these words the spectre took its

      1 as he or she went out wished him or her a Merry Christmas
      1 as he looked about him I was bred in this place I was
      1 as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present

      1 applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement
      1 appetite for it

      1 and when he had done so said
      1 and whenever we part from one another I am sure we

      1 and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a

      1 and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly
      1 and thither in restless haste and moaning as they
      1 and they were close at home by struggling men and they

      1 and the Spirit crossed the threshold Why did he not
      1 and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist
      1 and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of

      1 And then cried one of the girls Peter will be keeping
      1 and the man in faded black mounting the breach first

      1 and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass

      1 and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold
      1 and tender and the pulse a mans Strike Shadow strike
      1 and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour
      1 and stopped

      1 And so have I cried Peter Often
      1 and see me Will you come and see me
      1 And see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow
      1 And Scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe
      1 and sang it very well indeed
      1 and said that he would see him in that extremity first
