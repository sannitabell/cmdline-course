      1 words to her thought came quickly the echo of the scream had not ceased
      1 words that arrest both our understanding an inspiration came to me In
      1 words seemed to choke me The dear sisters were so kind Please God I
      1 words on my typewriter and none other need now hear your heart beat as
      1 words in tones which wrung my heart Then she tore her hair and beat her

      1 without special reason but just at present I am so interested in him
      1 without prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open mindDr
      1 without need And if there is no necessity for a postmortem and nothing
      1 without my noticing They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
      1 without my knowing it He must hypnotise me before the dawn and then I
      1 without her presence to embarrass us The Professor and I looked at each
      1 without effect Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
      1 Without a word the Professor bent over the bed his head almost touching
      1 without a word he rose and moving over sat down on the side of the

      1 With a glad heart I opened my door and ran down to the hall I had seen
      1 with a flying blush and changed her phraseto him who had best right
      1 with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place Poor dear she is

      1 What shall I do There was fire in his eyes and his open nostril
      1 What ridiculous nonsense you are talking He was getting too wide
      1 what poor Lucy died of not after all the hints given not only by

      1 What is that which you are using This time the question was by
      1 What is that way asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice What is that
      1 What is that time The voice was Quinceys but it was low and

      1 What I said You dont mean to tell me you dont care about
      1 what I am to do and I shall not falter Van Helsing laid a hand on his
      1 what he meant by that for he was very serious This was when we had

      1 what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood As
      1 what had occurred I fell asleep on the sofa however wondering over
      1 what had happened in the visit to the Counts house And yet he must
      1 Whatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to me
      1 What else do you hear
      1 What do you think of that he asked as he stood back and folded his

      1 What do you make of that mark on her throat
      1 What do you make of it
      1 What do you hear I could detect the strain in the Professors patient
      1 What does this tell us Not much no The Counts childthought see

      1 What can I do asked Arthur hoarsely Tell me and I shall do it My
      1 What brought you here I cried as our hands met
      1 what Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
      1 what a task we have in hand I must be careful not to frighten her Here
      1 What are you going to do I asked
      1 What are you doing
      1 What are we to do now Where are we to turn for help We must have
      1 What an asinine question
      1 what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours But we

      1 We were just in time said the Professor thankfully
      1 we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door One

      1 We took Lucy into another room which had by now been prepared and laid
      1     We thought her dying whilst she slept
      1 we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him I know now
      1 We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night and when she
      1 We then sought for Skinsky but were unable to find him One of his

      1 Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy and has consulted me

      1 Westenra I should never forgive myself if any act of mine were it even
      1 we start we go on land more quick and we meet him there Our best hope
      1 We shuddered with horror I could see by the tremulous light that even
      1 we should all work together As for me she said I have no fear
      1 We shook hands and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
      1 We shall wait said Van Helsing just long enough to fix the best
      1 We shall soon be off I am afraid to think what may happen to us We are
      1 We shall see said the Professor and with one impulse we took our way
      1 We shall see he answered as he hurried out He came back a moment
      1 We shall see
      1 We shall operate just above the ear

      1 too much of them I would get Dr Van Helsing or Dr Seward to prescribe

      1 took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming We did
      1 took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way I looked down
      1 took my way to Paddington where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
      1 took my luggage he had carried it in before I could forestall him I
      1 took me by both hands
      1 took it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing
      1 took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed
      1 took it differently Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a

      1 took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace This
      1 took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin Arthur
      1 took him from her kiss when she was dying I know he has forgiven me
      1 took her hand and patted it as he replied
      1 took hands as we sat and she told me all over again about Arthur and
      1 took from his neck inside his collar a little gold crucifix and
      1 tooked the bloomin boxes from
      1 took a hue of unreality and I did not know what to trust even the

      1 to my sittingroom and adjusted it for me Now I shall learn something
      1 to myself she cannot be far as she is only in her nightdress I ran
      1 to my own room The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand
      1 To my intense surprise there was no one with him He was quite alone
      1 To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked Suspiciously I

      1 To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope
      1 to me I had a letter from Arthur written on Sunday and from it I
      1 to me He held out a hand which Quincey took
      1 to me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountiful
      1 to meet themmen and women the aged and the children tooand waited
      1 to me but you will sleep I pray I passed to my room and went to bed

      1 to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds I have me antherums
      1 to loose the band Just over the external jugular vein there were two
      1 to look for them Then we drifted into other matters

      1 told us that when he and Dr Van Helsing had gone down to the room below
      1 told us so much he went on
      1 told us of their gloating lips you heard their ribald laugh as they
      1 told that he will be pay well and though he swear much at the first he
      1 told on her more than before for though plenty of blood went into her
      1 told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
      1 told him there was something and crossed themselves Mate lost temper
      1 told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be
      1 told her I should ask you to see her and though she demurred at

      1 toilet I trust you will find all you wish When you are ready come
      1 to hypnotise her but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep from which I

      1 to him I must find out later on Tonight he will not speak Even the
      1 to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion for at
      1 to him he asked them what they had seen or done To which Lord Godalming
      1 to him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with blood
      1 to him Come my child take her hand in yours and kiss her on the

      1 to guard alone Besides I may be of service since you can hypnotise me
      1 to go Van Helsing was very kind to him Come my child he said
      1 to go to the diningroom and have each a glass of wine The door flew
      1 to go through with the details Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
      1 to go at least to wait a day or two before starting It was all very
      1 to give him a chance of reaching the trap How he came there I know

      1 something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an

      1 something for me which would make me sleep only that I fear to alarm
      1 something each from the other We were afraid to think The answer came
      1 something directly I cannot quite understand it
      1 something coming out of the Counts window I drew back and watched
      1 something but as I took it that it was with a purpose I said nothing
      1 something as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
      1 something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if

      1 some new clue
      1 Some may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to so love him
      1 some little time and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
      1 some letters from you which show how great friends you were and how you
      1 some lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam but
      1 some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water and that
      1 some kind I know it for now and then I hear a faraway muffled sound
      1 some kind as there ever is over snow and it seemed as though the

      1 some intention of its own The patient grew calmer every instant and
      1 somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once Would I were he

      1 Somehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
      1 somehow it does not satisfy me It does not read like him and yet it is
      1 some hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argument
      1 some fixed idea in a wonderful way I am loath to think it and indeed

      1 some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
      1 some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new

      1 some chord in his memory If this new phase was spontaneous or in any

      1 so many sorrows have come
      1 so many opportunities of studying I was at first interested and
      1 so long and let him watch all night but he was quite right I am a new
      1 solicitude and when he had finished with his penitent said
      1 solicitor I asked him to explain more fully so that I might not by any
      1 solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you
      1 solemnly pointed to the scar I saw that she was in earnest and said
      1 solemnly
      1 solemnity its gloom its sadness its horror and withal its
      1 solemn compact was made I felt my heart icy cold but it did not even
      1 so I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but
      1 So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep Things
      1 So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfastroom where
      1 So I took the hint and came too I was too excited to sleep but this
      1 so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
      1 so I said
      1 so in time death which is of mans common lot and with Gods sanction
      1 so I hope I did right I have locked the door and the key is tied to
      1 so I could not see Lucys bed I stole across and felt for her The bed
      1 So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
      1 So I can finish this diary and God only knows if I shall ever begin
      1 So he took the papers with him and went away and I sit here
      1 So here we are installed in this beautiful old house and from both my
      1 Sohere he shut the dark slide of his lanternnow to the outside
      1 so he decide he go back home He find ship going by the route he came
      1 so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
      1 So he came to London to invade a new land He was beaten and when all
      1 so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work
      1 so glad I have typewritten out my own journal so that in case he asks
      1 so funny to hear my wife called Madam Mina by this kindly
      1 so full of volcanic energy as at present It is just as that dear good
      1 so full of love and tenderness Jonathan dear and you all my true
      1 softly to him
      1 softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it She looks paler than

      1 softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty that this was

      1 so First a little refreshment to reward my exertions You may as well
      1 So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath and when we
      1 sofas You shall lie on one and I on the other and our sympathy will
      1 So far he said our night has been eminently successful No harm has
      1 so far from us and so low on the horizon now seem to gather round us
      1 sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
      1 so early that the policemen who have then little to think of shall deem
      1 so dearand I must be fair Men like women certainly their wives to
      1 so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
      1 so close to me the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and
      1 so classify him and quâ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind
      1 so cannot leave the ship As he dare not change to mans form without
      1 so calm and our blood not so bright than yours Arthur turned to him
      1 sobs
      1 so brave And too it made me think of the wonderful power of money
      1 So be it that he has gone elsewhere Good It has given us opportunity
      1 sobbing He looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinked
      1 so at Fundu where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth we got a

      1 soaped There was something pathetic in it that touched me it also gave

      1 so
      1 snow was not more pale and no word she said But when I drew near she
      1 snows In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
      1 snowgloom I was desolate and afraid and full of woe and terror but
      1 snowflurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
      1 snow flurries and I could see a long way round From the height where we
      1 snow as they were I could see from the mens clothes that they were
      1 snow
      1 snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up Then
      1 Snelling today
      1 snatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishingboat with

      1 smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a

      1 Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves taking a late tea out of a
      1 smoke the cigarette in the garden whiles you and I have little talk all
      1 smile look malignant and saturnine
      1 smiled positively smiled as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and
      1 smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied
      1 smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves
      1 smells of horror which she might never forget One lesson too we have
      1 small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in
      1 small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and
      1 small I counsel you put down in record even your doubts and surmises
      1 smaller matters when the motherspirit is invoked I felt this big
      1 smaller He held up his hand and they all stopped and I thought he
      1 small deer as Shakespeare has it chickenfeed of the larder they
      1 small and he can at times vanish and come unknown How then are we to

      1 Slovaks When they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall
      1 Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth I read in
      1 Slovaks and a chance thrustfor I dont suppose these fellows carry
      1 slip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost something
      1 slight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and I secured
      1 slightly torn or wounded in the throat The wounds seem such as might be
      1 slightly parted and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
      1 slewed round a little so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
      1 slept with more or less reality of sleep
      1 slept soundly for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed but the
      1 slept on after we had been called We had a happy surprise at breakfast
      1 slept and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her between
      1 sleepy as I should have been so before they went I asked Dr Seward to
      1 sleep when those she loves are in danger I shall lie down and pretend
      1 sleepwalking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me and which now I
      1 sleepwalking and not about Jonathan Then I shall never know the real
      1 sleep The storm was fearful and as it boomed loudly among the
      1 sleep The others were dazed at first but as remembrance came back to
      1 sleep Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for I remember no
      1 sleep I write this now as I am not sleepy though I must try again
      1 sleeping I am on watch The morning is bitterly cold the furnace heat
      1 sleeping he said
      1 sleeping and waking Whilst asleep she looked stronger although more
      1 sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little
      1 sleeping and the sun low down But all was indeed changed the frowning
      1 sleeping and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
      1 sleeping and sleeping without dreams I fear what her dreams might be
      1 sleep He think too that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind
      1 sleep has not refreshed me for today I feel terribly weak and
      1 sleep for a while as it is enough for the present for one to be on
      1 sleep come to her too late but so heavy that she will not wake I have
      1 sleep as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon He insists that I shall
      1 sleep Arthur went off with him casting back a longing look on Lucys
      1 sleep and seeing me cried out in pain that I had endured too much
      1 sleep And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief and sank
      1 sleep

      1 slack tide See and the sun is just rose and all day to sunset is to
      1 sky
      1 skin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand that
      1 sketches of the Prelude to the Great Storm will grace the R A and R
      1 skeleton keys If so that we can open the door we need not break house
      1 sixtynine and yet that poor Lucy with four mens blood in her poor
      1 sit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of the
      1 sitting up in bed with a startled look on her face I could see easily
      1 sitting beside me They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
      1 sit over our roofs with brooding wings Lucy lies in the tomb of her
      1 sit here very often myself and work Indeed I am writing now with my

      1 SISTER AGATHA
      1 Sir you have come in time You are the lover of our dear miss She is
      1 sir was again his laconic reply
      1 Sir I said you could have no better claim on me than that you were
      1 sir into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiments which
      1 sir for coming When first the Professors eye had lit upon him he had
      1 sinking off to sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
      1 sinking fast he might die at any moment I looked up at the Professor
      1 since whilst we talked action was impossible But Van Helsing held up
      1 since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
      1 since we were children we have slept together and eaten together and
      1 since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil and so have
      1 Sincerity It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
      1 since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass
      1 since I said Finis and yet here I am starting fresh again or rather
      1 since I had the idea of going to London have given me many many hours
      1 since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph
      1 since been removedas from Dr Sewards diary I fear
      1 simultaneously moved towards him and took his arms We could hear the
      1 Simply that there is some cause in common Whatever it was that injured
      1 simply gorged with blood He lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his
      1 simply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral Already it is
      1 simply accept fact and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
      1 simple She have yet no life taken though that is of time and to act
      1 simple seriousness He thought for a moment and then said May I have
      1 similarity to those which had been on Lucys throat They were smaller
      1 similar instances of womans kindness I got back here in time for a
      1 similar authorisation to his agent at Varna We have seen the agent who
      1 silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have
      1 silent with respect There are others too which I shall tell you of
      1 silent we could do nothing At length she grew more calm and turning to
      1 silent mysterywas beautiful beyond words Between me and the moonlight
      1 silent for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude The
      1 silent awhile and during his silence Dr Van Helsing spoke
      1 silence until he asked again
      1 Silence If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out
      1 silence
      1 signs which however I could not understand any more than I could
      1 signs of an internal struggle I put it down myself to her making a
      1 sign of a man in it except myself This was startling and coming on
      1 significantly and coughed For answer he put his finger on his lips and
      1 sight Alas I am unclean to His eyes and shall be until He may deign
      1 sight
      1 side there rises for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edge of
      1 side of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhich
      1 side of the harbour who at once ran down to the little pier was the
      1 side From his putting his finger to his lips I gathered that he

      1 side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the Borgo Pass One
      1 side and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
      1 shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles
      1 Shut the door I shall wait till morning and covered my face with my
      1 shuts I hear the creaking of lock and bolt
      1 shut and knew that the Count had returned He did not come at once into
      1 shudder ran through her increasing in intensity for a few seconds
      1 shudder ran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm was a
      1 shudder For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and then
      1 shuddered whilst she moaned Van Helsing had not intended to recall her
      1 shudder at the presence of this being this UnDead as Van Helsing
      1 shrank back The Professor was the first to move forward and stepped
      1 shown up to Lucys room If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday I
      1 shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now no
      1 show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist I must be
      1 showing off so I put in a word to keep him going
      1 show for it I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams for
      1 shouting for a ticket for home Seeing from his violent demeanour that
      1 Should we disturb her
      1 should thwart us in all we try to do I shall take this cylinder with
      1 should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction and his
      1 Should the charge be less than this amount you can return balance if
      1 should set Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them Neither the
      1 shouldnt be surprised if the census is one babby the less Thats
      1 should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help Is it that there
      1 should have were he much giftedand a womans heart The good God
      1 should have known better I demurred as to my not sharing any danger
      1 should have kept their energies for use closer to home Whilst they
      1 should have been in some way drawn into the affair and so detained
      1 should faint I was filled with anxiety about Lucy not only for her
      1 shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will
      1 shoulders and Jonathan wants looking after still He is beginning to

      1 shoulder and said
      1 should disturb her The Professor smiled and looked quite jubilant He
      1 should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders so
      1 should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy and whom he may have
      1 should be I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room
      1 short Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed
      1 short time before him That he is not here already shows that he went to
      1 Shortly before ten oclock the stillness of the air grew quite
      1 short Before long they streamed away singly licking their lips
      1 shore tonight or before dawn there will be the whole day lost to him

      1 shock to her would mean sudden death and this in Lucys weak
      1 shock that he experienced tells upon him the most Oh it is too hard
      1 shock my door was fastened on the outside
      1 shocked the New Woman with our appetites Men are more tolerant bless
      1 shock and thrill me for it was said as if he did not know that it was
      1 shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat
      1 shivering glass I could hear the ting of the gold as some of the
      1 shirt and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast When
      1 ships leave for the Black Sea last night He was in sailing ship since

      1 she would have you to if for her to choose For she is not a grinning
      1 she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness or if
      1 she was very low in thought and spirit and wept silently and weakly for
      1 she was so hungry that she would not wait I like it not and I have
      1 She was right in her instinct Strange as it all was bizarre as it may
      1 She was restless and uneasy all the time and I cannot but think that
      1 She was pleased with the prospect of anything to doif pleased could
      1 she was Now isnt that stean at any ratehe hammered it with his
      1 She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her but
      1 she was conscious and which we saw with grinding of our
      1 she was better dead
      1 she turned on me as she spoke and if there be indeed a Recording Angel
      1 She tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her
      1 she took her husbands grey head in her hands and kissed itLay your
      1 She took but a little and that languidly There did not seem to be with
      1 She told me that if she might she would come presently to my study as
      1 She threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the same
      1 she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
      1 she succeed She sleep all the time till at the last I feel myself to
      1 She still advanced however and with a languorous voluptuous grace
      1 She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor pale
      1 She shook her head as she said again
      1 She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there the pointed teeth
      1 She seemed however to know the situation without telling though she
      1 She said
      1 sherry and kawffee so to speak afore I tries on with the

      1 She ought to be here by now That she is still journeying somewhere is
      1 She moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfasted early As
      1 She may have been placed here since last night
      1 She makes a very beautiful corpse sir Its quite a privilege to
      1 she made the rest of us bring chairs up close Taking her husbands hand
      1 shelving cliffs others broke over the piers and with their spume swept
      1 sheltered in the friendly soil
      1 She looks so sweet as she sleeps but she is paler than is her wont and
      1 she live on UnDead more and more they lose their blood and by her
      1 She know it not and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
      1 she is young woman and not so long married there may be other things to
      1 she is with that Vampire baptism Well said I to myself if it be
      1 she is well fed and that nothing disturbs her You must not sleep all

      1 She is so sweet with old people I think they all fell in love with her
      1 She is one of Gods women fashioned by His own hand to show us men and

      1 she had not hunger I did not press her knowing her unavailingness But
      1 she had much to say So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
      1 she had grown more quiet
      1 she gets weaker and more languid day by day at night I hear her gasping
      1 sheet the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
      1 sheepskin and high boots They had also their long staves in hand I
      1 sheep in a butchers You shall be sorry yet each one of you You think
      1 She did not stir again all night
      1 she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
      1 she came in She looked sweetly pretty but very sad and her eyes were
      1 she been buried alive He groaned in anguish that not even hope could

      1 she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
      1 sharp whisper Draw up the blind I want light Then he bent down
      1 sharper than usual when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
      1 sharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answered
      1 shapesaw us she drew back with an angry snarl such as a cat gives
      1 shapes And then I started broad awake and in full possession of my
      1 shape go back to Carfax but he evidently sought some other lair He

      1 not upset him again I shall try to save him from it but it may be even
      1 not try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and was
      1 not touch it he cannot achieve the land In such case he can if it be

      1 not the only thing which could pass away
      1 not take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay a while
      1 not stop to think All big and little must go down perhaps at the end
      1 not still get it and think there was to you no conscience of the
      1 not start either so promptly or so well equipped as it will within
      1 not so Well now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall

      1 not seem a short time either for the draining away of ones blood no
      1 No trifling with me I never jest There is grim purpose in all I do
      1 not remove anything from Lucys room without consulting him that the
      1 no tremble of hand or heart do operations of life and death that make
      1 No trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is much
      1 not quite hear or understand We must be ready at all points Dr
      1 not perhaps well And if I workas work I shall no matter trust or no
      1 not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it I knew pretty
      1 not often can such a sight have been seen The man was simply fastened
      1 not occur again Here we stay until all be wellor ill Quincey held
      1 not much heed though I am myself very fond of animals One of the men
      1 Not much flies are poor things after all After a pause he added
      1 not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down
      1 not listen to my objection She said that there might be some law matter
      1 not like herself She sleeps and sleeps and sleeps She who is usual
      1 not let it away for some days

      1 not I shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral that
      1 not introduced me I was so much astonished that the oddness of
      1 not interrupt him he cannot go back and maybe could not proceed at all
      1 not I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bedI imagine that

      1 notice that my clumsiness with the safetypin hurt her Indeed it might
      1 notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes Of
      1 notice my window opened into the courtyard all I could see was the

      1 nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions and all
      1 nothing therefore he speak so free Your manthought see nothing my
      1 nothing of them I shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening and with
      1 nothing could be done so I went round to the back to see if anything
      1 nothing but sweet dreams Well here I am tonight hoping for sleep
      1 nothing as the shadow of a cloud obscured St Marys Church and all
      1 nothing and there is merely the stream of the Esk running between
      1 Nothing all is dark And to the second
      1 not hear them now but if it may be that she can see them again they
      1 Not having power to work sails have to run before wind Dare not lower
      1 not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are today However
      1      not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of
      1 not go They will be home by this
      1 not go fast though the way was steeply downhill for we had to take
      1 not get my telegram
      1 Not for your life he said not for your living soul and hers And
      1 not forget this night
      1 not find the Count anywhere So I breakfasted alone It is strange that
      1 not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things He laid
      1 not feel dizzyI suppose I was too excitedand the time seemed
      1 notepaper envelopes and pens and ink All were covered up in thin
      1 notepaper and three envelopes They were all of the thinnest foreign
      1 Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau Berkeley Hotel directed to
      1 notebook which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
      1 notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself and Van Helsings memorandum
      1 notebook and he said to me very solemnly
      1                                   NOTE
      1 not despair There is but one more earthbox and we must try to find
      1 Not delivered
      1 not deceive him and that it is all true It may be that it is the doubt
      1 not conceal The Count evidently noticing it drew back and with a
      1 not come to its master who was on the seat with us but kept a few
      1 not but smile at which he grimaced I gave myself away that time he
      1 not but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and
      1 not bring myself to the attempt He looked very sad but did not
      1 not be wanting for help
      1 not be from that unlucky prick of the safetypin I looked at her throat
      1 not been terrible memories to spur us on we could hardly have proceeded
      1 Not at all I answered Come in My work is finished and I am free
      1 not ask him for fear I shall do more harm than good but I must somehow
      1 not argue I procured him a double supply and left him as happy a man
      1 notand must not yet understand But the time will come when your trust
      1 not And I am afraid afraid afraidI am afraid of all thingseven
      1 not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
      1 nostrils that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down and the

      1 No she said quite simply it will not be necessary You can tell
      1 no shadow on the floor They came close to me and looked at me for some
      1 noses like the Count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be
      1 nose and a pointed beard with a few white hairs runnin through it He
      1 No says he not exactly in the business but I ave made pets of
      1 No said I unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone

      1 no one will interfere I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine
      1 No one need ever know shall ever know I said in a low voice She
      1 No one knew where he went or bloomin well cared as they said for
      1 noon and sunset and so engage with him when he is at his most weak
      1 Nonsense Mina It is a shame to me to hear such a word I would not

      1 No I said I waited till I had seen you as I said in my telegram I
      1 No I said in a way that I felt was aggressive
      1 No I replied but Mina wants to see Dr Van Helsing at once

      1 nobleman Count de Ville who effected the purchase himself paying the
      1 noble as that of the young Casabiancaand placed in the mortuary to
      1 nobility that I feel more than everand it has grown with my advancing
      1 nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance And yet unless my

      1 night When he had completed it he stood beside me again saying
      1 night We dont mean to take any chances
      1 night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset Each of us

      1 night there was no exodus so tonight before the sundown I took away my
      1 night there is plenty of water and the banks are wide enough apart to
      1 nights rest Then he went on

      1 night one of my postdated letters went to post the first of that fatal
      1 night now the day is on us bright though cold There is a strange
      1 night mail and would join me early in the morning
      1 night just as the moon rose he grew quiet and kept murmuring to

      1 night I came in having in the meantime had supper and took a seat by
      1 night I am feeling very sleepy the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
      1 night he suddenly said
      1 night he shall be well We shall leave him where the police will find
      1 night but she gets up and walks about the room and sits at the open
      1 night but lose no time there is not an instant to spare There was no
      1 night But if need be I shall come again in three days and stay longer
      1 night As we travel on the rough road for a road of an ancient and
      1 night another man lostdisappeared Like the first he came off his

      1 me Mina very straightforwardly He told me how dear I was to him
      1 me lest I want it later I may find a way from this dreadful place

      1 me and there is a clatter of a donkeys hoofs up the paved road below
      1 me and then I can complete my entry on Lucys phonograph
      1 me And then a red cloud like the colour of blood seemed to close
      1 me and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us
      1 me and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry
      1 me a lesson for it seemed that before me was a childonly a child
      1 me a doctors preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
      1 may succeed Our enemy is at his most helpless and if we can come on
      1 may state my intellectual position I am so far as concerns things
      1 may solve only in part Believe me we are now on the verge of one But
      1 may seem to me And then to follow of your Lordships wishes I shall

      1 May I come also asked Lord Godalming
      1 May I ask you something now
      1 May He bless and keep you
      1 may have stolen it I felt that I was speaking folly and yet it was
      1 May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
      1 may find Sam soon or I maynt but anyhow he aint like to be in a way
      1 may discover what the box contain Thus in fine if he escape not on

      1 matters I had been examined in at Lincolns Inn There was a certain
      1 matter seemed preying on his mind and so I determined to use itto be
      1 matter it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our

      1 matter how willingly it be given is a terrible feelingVan Helsing
      1 matter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong

      1 I would like to oblige you if I could Mr Harker and especially would
      1 I would if there were no friend who loved me who would save me such a

      1 I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took
      1 I woke Madam Mina and again tried to hypnotise her but alas
      1 I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart Will you let me
      1 I will try to but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical
      1 I will strengthen me with breakfast and then I will to my terrible

      1 I who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to Newcastle or
      1 I were awake It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and I
      1 I went up the steps Then I had a vague memory of something long and
      1 I went to the diningroom and waked him He was dazed for a moment but
      1 I went to bed as usual taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr
      1 I went over and tried it and the door was locked
      1 I went out to see that all was right and it was and then the owling
      1 I went on with my work I had just finished Mrs Harkers diary when
      1 I went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had found
      1 I went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little to
      1 I went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at

      1 I went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of the
      1 I was waked by the flapping at the window which had begun after that
      1 I was uneasy about you darling and came in to see that you were all
      1 I was undressing in my own room when with a premonitory tap at the
      1 I was touched by the tenderness of his tone and asked why
      1 I was staggered but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good

      1 I was not alone The room was the same unchanged in any way since I
      1 I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint
      1 I was It rather upset me for a bit There has been so much trouble
      1 I was ill I have had a shock but you have cured me already
      1 I was handing him the halfsovereign when something came bobbing up
      1 I was glad when the coastguard came along with his spyglass under his
      1 I was firm however and told him that he could not have it whereupon
      1 I was awakened by the Count who looked at me as grimly as a man can
      1 I was at dinner suggesting that I should be at Hillingham tonight as
      1 I was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under
      1 I want you to read the Burial Service She was interrupted by a deep
      1 I want you to hypnotise me she said Do it before the dawn for I
      1 I want you to do me a favour Lucy is ill that is she has no special
      1 I want you to come with me and to come in secret to the churchyard at
      1 I want your permission to do what I think good this night It is I
      1 I want to say something to you miss I could see he was not at ease
      1 I wanted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so I thanked him
      1 I walls in May next More than one captain made up his mind then and
      1 I walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweet
      1 I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin but he stood as
      1 I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and laid down
      1 I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country and it may be
      1 it you or me
      1 It would comfort me my husband was all she said and he began to
      1 it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the

      1 it will throw some light upon Jonathans sad experience and as he
      1 it will soon after fall into dust In such case there would be no
      1 It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend as a
      1 it when the time came and saw everything Poor Lucy seemed much upset
      1 it when that is done all may yet be well I could see that he spoke as
      1 it what it is But alas as yet I only know your tongue through books
      1 it we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could All fell out
      1 it were the end of the world
      1 it were only a single line Lucy walks more than ever and each night I
      1 it was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to uswe found
      1 it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted I have not
      1 It was The Professor turned to the rest saying
      1 It was then time to start So I said farewell to Mina a parting which
      1 It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned Aha he
      1 It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us
      1 It was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself dissociated
      1 It was possible if not likely the Professor urged that the Count
      1 It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz which is a
      1 it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask and so that you might not
      1 It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised or even awed for
      1 it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my being
      1 It was now nearly one oclock and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
      1 It was now late in the afternoon and sunset was not far off We had to
      1 it was like tea after the teapot had been watered Here we all moved
      1 It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God No one must hear them
      1 It was like a miracle but before our very eyes and almost in the
      1 It was just a quarter before twelve oclock when we got into the
      1 it was he thought that on the attendants evidence he could give a
      1 It was halfpast two oclock when the knock came I took my courage à
      1 It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
      1 It was certainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but
      1 It was by this time close on morning and we went to bed Mem this
      1 it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work and
      1 It was an idiotic thing of me to do and I ask your pardon Mrs
      1 It was a lonely vigil Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
      1 it was
      1 I turned to wake Jonathan but found that he slept so soundly that it
      1 it to me to read One passage of it at least gave me a thrill of
      1 Ittin of them over the ead with a pole is one way scratchin of
      1 it through the gloom of the night At the first howl the horses began to
      1 it there was I now see something of cruelty I seemed to wish to keep
      1 itthe little children can be bitten Are you of belief now friend

      1 it strange but we shall go after ten oclock when there are many
      1 its potency and she fell into a deep sleep When the Professor was
      1 It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier as
      1 its more lively and sprucelooking neighbours We sat down on a bench
      1 it slowly opened It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in
      1 itself was as peaceful and wellbehaved as that father of all
      1 itself through the room On the instant the Professor spoke again
      1 itself out of good things in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
      1 itself it does not even need a womans love to hear its music
      1 itself a vigorous state of health In other physical matters I was quite
      1 It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east and
      1 it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town It may be that it
      1 It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made and yet how much
      1 It seems an age since I heard from you or indeed since I wrote You
      1 it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
      1 It seemed so funny to hear you order me about as if I were a bad
      1 I try to hypnotise her but alas with no effect the power has grown
      1 I trust you will forgive me but I have much work to do in private this
      1 I trust that good habit have not fail Remember my friend that
      1 it really is I have not yet been able to see it by daylight
      1 I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for a
      1 I took it in turns to watch and we never left her for a moment
      1 I took his hand and promised him I held my door open as he went away
      1 I took her with me When I went into the room I told the man that a
      1 I took Arthur by the arm and led him away to the drawingroom where he
      1 itone is from you and to my friend Peter Hawkins the otherhere
      1 I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the
      1 it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
      1 it now On the watch last night I saw It like a man tall and thin
      1 it not and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
      1 it not and swear at him in many tongues and tell him that if he like he
      1 It need not go in if you do not wish it but I pray that it may It can
      1 it might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving by the
      1 it meanwhat it might mean Just as there are elements which rest
      1 It may not be too late Let us be armedthe same as we were the other
      1 It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit
      1 It makes me rage to think that this can go on and whilst I am shut up
      1 it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep This turned my blood
      1 it loss and wreck and sore distress and sad hearts Look look he
      1 Itll be something to keep off the darkness now and then You can you
      1 it lest it too were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found
      1 It is the man himself
      1 It is the eve of St Georges Day Do you not know that tonight when
      1 it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
      1 It is sold sir
      1 It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature Let
      1 It is perhaps well he said that at our meeting after our visit to
      1 It is only about 24 hours sail from the Dardanelles to here at the
      1 It is now drawing towards the sunset Minas uneasiness calls my
      1 It is now close to the time of our general gathering Van Helsing has
      1 It is not yet too late Quick quick Bring the brandy
      1 It is not too late It beats though but feebly All our work is
      1 It is nice at high water but when the tide is out it shoals away to
      1 It is needless I have seen him
      1 It is nearly all over now Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate
      1 It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
      1 It is like poor Lucys
      1 it is I who would have to go to keep them company
      1 It is I suppose the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had
      1 it is hot flit down on them and thenand then in the morning are
      1 It is her body and yet not it But wait a while and you all see her
      1 It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea hastening on
      1 it is entirelyalmost entirelyabout my cases it may be awkwardthat
      1 It is enough You attend him I will look to her When all was over I
      1 It is destroying my nerve I start at my own shadow and am full of all
      1 It is a wild adventure we are on Here as we are rushing along through
      1      It is a selected list every book in it has achieved a certain
      1 it is all sweet to me but because you have been and are very dear to
      1 It is all right We found both places six boxes in each and we
      1 It is all over said Van Helsing She is dead
      1 It is all done poor dear dear Jonathan what he must have suffered
      1 it I said to him
      1 it is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in a
      1 It is
      1 it in my diary which I shall show you later I felt the same vague
      1 it In any case I am to have a letter
      1 itI looked about for something to read for I did not like to go about
      1 it Ill find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye tonight But
      1 it I am glad to say that though I was crying I was able to look into
      1 I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics
      1 I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get and so
      1 I thought that I was asleep and waiting for Jonathan to come back I
      1 I thought that he too had come through in safety but as he sprang
      1 I thought I would watch for the Counts return and for a long time sat
      1 I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically so I said
      1 I thought he might have the keys on him but when I went to search I saw
      1 I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
      1 I thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemed
      1 I think we were all staggered For my own part I was under the
      1 I think that will do now Simmons We have done all that we can at
      1 I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
      1 I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs
      1 I think sir his back is broken See both his right arm and leg and
      1 I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically so I
      1 I think I had better go with Quincey We have been accustomed to hunt
      1 I think I came just in the nick of time You know you have only to tell
      1 I think he understood my look I hope he did
      1 I think and believe not without its reward Van Helsing had placed at
      1 It have told him She must have told him pg 169
      1 It has always been at nighttime that I have been molested or
      1 it hard in silencebut now you are here you are more good than us
      1 I thank you sir said Van Helsing proudly I have done myself the
      1 I thank you my friend for your all tooflattering estimate but yet I
      1 it had given a scream so wild so earpiercing so despairing that it
      1 it grow into a habit No I shall take none tonight I have thought of
      1 It grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall
      1 It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
      1 it for myself Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way he said
      1 it for luck lazily went each to his horses head Shortly afterwards I
      1 it for it may be that  I must write no more I must keep it to say
      1 I tell you what I propose first that we go off now and see that child
      1 It does he said solemnly
      1 it Dare you come with me
      1 it Can see you any time you call
      1 it but the strange things the extraordinary things the things that
      1 it be that she can by our hypnotic trance tell what the Count see and
      1 it before I felt you
      1 it be a willothewisp to man It was an odd experience and we all
      1 It be all fooltalk lock stock and barrel thats what it be an
      1 it At the worst it can only be death and a mans death is not a
      1 it at least more than we do Which is the way to the chapel I had an
      1 It astonished me how long the drug took to act This in fact marked
      1 it As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of BudaPesth
      1 it a secret dear from every one except of course Jonathan You
      1 it And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
      1 it and said tenderly
      1 it and pain Shall you not all help me We have learned to believe all
      1 it and now he wants me to tell him what she knows so that he may
      1 It and gave It my knife but the knife went through It empty as the
      1 it A minute later he came in and said
      1 it amazed me that I had not seen him since the reflection of the glass
      1 it all right and he is going on well
      1 I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did

      1 I discovered that I was half famished with hunger so making a hasty
      1 I die that I may live When I am thus dead in the flesh then you will
      1 I didnt quite dream but it all seemed to be real I only wanted to be

      1 I did
      1 I desire it much nay I will take no refusal When your master
      1 idea struck me and I looked up Well he said
      1 ideas but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on

      1 I could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of me
      1 I could not tell the others of the days discovery till we were alone
      1 I could not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms I
      1 I could not pity her for I knew now what had become of her child and
      1 I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Minas
      1 I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had
      1 I could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which a
      1 I could love him in time and when I shook my head his hands trembled
      1 I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
      1 I could helpthat it often happened that after death faces became
      1 I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath and he said to me in a
      1 I could find no means of ingress Every window and door was fastened and
      1 I could enter I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
      1 I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless but I could not see
      1 I could
      1 I comforted him as well as I could In such cases men do not need much
      1 I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waitedwaited with beating
      1 icemore like the hand of a dead than a living man Again he said
      1 Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them which their
      1 I care for nothing now he answered hotly except to wipe out this
      1 I cant understand the two things He could mark his face like that by
      1 I cant quite remember how I fell asleep last night I remember hearing
      1 I cant make her out he said shes a Russian by the look of her
      1 I can tell you I think Dr Van Helsing all about it
      1 I can see nothing we are still there are no waves lapping but only a
      1 I can see nothing it is all dark
      1 I can promise that nothing will happen
      1 I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself I reminded her
      1 I cannot sleep so I make this entry But I must try to get a few hours
      1 I cannot and remained silent I rejoiced for I knew that what she
      1 I cannot afford to lose blood just at present I have lost too much of
      1 I can never thank you all enough Oh my poor darling As she spoke
      1 I can hear the waves lapping against the ship and the water rushing
      1 I can go with you now if you like
      1 I can do this all that can be at the present You go wake those maids
      1 I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you I have
      1 I came to speak about the certificate of death If we do not act
      1 I came tiptoe into our own room and found Mina asleep breathing so
      1 I came off too to report the only exclusive information that is given
      1 I came herewith good purpose believe me I opened that coffin which
      1 I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees It is then so near
      1 I broke it fine so that all was well guarded She sat still all the
      1 I Besides it was all so confused it seemed only a moment from his
      1 I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window Then I looked
      1 I believe it is the Count but he has grown young My God if this be
      1 I begins to arsk them questions
      1 I awoke in my own bed If it be that I had not dreamt the Count must
      1 I assured him sadly that it was so and went on to suggestfor I felt
      1 I answer for Mina and myself he said
      1 I answered that I had not that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of
      1 I answered him
      1 I answered Do not press me too hard all at once I am willing to
      1 I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
      1 I am younger and stronger Professor It must be me
      1 I am with you said Lord Godalming for Lucys sake if for no other
      1 I am weary tonight and low in spirits I cannot but think of Lucy and
      1 I am weak at present and perhaps because it was on Lucys account that
      1 I am very very grateful to you I thought it well to leave him in this
      1 I am too agitated to sleep We have had such an adventure such an
      1 I am told Madam Mina by my friend John that you and your husband have
      1 I am stilloh so still It is like death The voice faded away into
      1 I am satisfied that Lucys body is not in that coffin but that only

      1 I am old and worn I give my time my skill my sleep I let my other
      1 I am now I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left
      1 I am not surprised Just now I doubted for a moment myself
      1 I am more than ever sure that I am right My new conclusion is ready so
      1 I am longing to be with you and by the sea where we can talk together
      1 I am here to do Your bidding Master I am Your slave and You will
      1 I am here it is you who would laugh I have learned not to think little

      1 I agree with you with all my heart I answered earnestly for I did
      1 I acquiesced But to think that he keeps anything from me And now I am

      1 horror that lay upon it
      1 horrors when I get to port When I get to port Will that ever be
      1 horror but as I looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful

      1 horrid blowfly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the room
      1 horrible strongsmelling flowers about everywhere and she had actually
      1 horrible sort of snarl passed over his face showing the eyeteeth long
      1 horrible sinking in my heart and from Van Helsings face I gathered
      1 horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what I would I could
      1 hope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing will
      1 hope of success was lost and his existence in danger he fled back over
      1 hopelessly fast I was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closing
      1 hopeless and work Work work
      1 hope he didnt think it forward of me and that if he ever thinks of it
      1 hope for except the pity of the good God Lord Godalming had slipped
      1 hope and determination we have got everything in order for tonight I
      1 honour youas well as more esteem and love She took it back with
      1 honour of counting you one trusting friend and such endorsement is dear

      1 homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous The
      1 home with your husband I wish you could be coming home soon enough to
      1 home We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways into
      1 home to them Is it not so As he spoke he handed me three sheets of
      1 home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath In all
      1 home But he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst I ate
      1 holy still It was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it to
      1 Holmwood If you will let me have his lordships address I will consult
      1 Holmwood He often comes to see us and he and mamma get on very well
      1 hold perhaps in one of those boxes Ill unscrew them one by one and
      1 hold of his hand to stop him He only said You shall see and again
      1 hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where
      1 holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince
      1 holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was
      1 hold him for I was anxious to see what he would do He went straight
      1 hold and work is good for himthere came up the hatchway a sudden
      1 hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts If this goes
      1 Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
      1 his writing There is no mistake of that Lucy has not walked much in
      1 His wrath
      1 his work of going his round of the patients when he had finished he
      1 his window saw the red disc sink As it sank he became less and less
      1 his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog The animal
      1 His voice was weaker so I moistened his lips with the brandy again and
      1 his victimme
      1 his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height he turned
      1 his usual forethought been putting matters straight and making
      1 his tea when I found him Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk
      1 his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
      1 his spiders and flies not five minutes before Looking at my watch I
      1 his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it
      1 his seriousness lightlyfor after all four days of rest and freedom
      1 his selfish good turns out to be his chiefest harm The hunter is taken
      1 hisself and more like hes somewhere round the Park aidin an
      1 his seat and we resumed our journey I think I must have fallen asleep
      1 his sanction I shall use some
      1 his room is on this side of the house I could hear it better than in
      1 his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
      1 his right hand and Lord Godalming his left Jonathan held my right with
      1 His reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical and
      1 His red eyes again They are just the same It was such an odd
      1 his race
      1 his power over the brute world for the only or the last time tonight
      1 his part Then there was the sound of a struggle and I knew that the
      1 his palms together in a perfect agony of grief He stood up and then sat
      1 his palms together in a helpless way finally he sat down on a chair
      1 his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the
      1 his own room and to have his notebook again I thought it well to
      1 his own care Mr Holmwood introduced him to me and he called here to
      1      his outbursts I should have been prepared to sign for him after a
      1 his old companion the stationmaster at Kings Cross so that when I
      1 his missal and began to read and Quincey and I followed as well as we
      1 his manner as well as his words when he said
      1 his love He must not stay here Hold a moment I may take it sir
      1 his look is a warning There must be no tears nowunless it may be that
      1 His look and gesture forbade discussion so I came back and told Mina
      1 his list of natures eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
      1 his life He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
      1 his left and stretched across to Mr Morris So as we all took hands our
      1 his landlord who had received by messenger the key of the house
      1 His is a curious case indeed we must watch him tonight
      1      his instinct is satisfied as to the vampires ultimate triumph
      1 his injury The whole motor area seems affected The suffusion of the
      1 his imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes
      1 his hump and asks it to be took as evidence
      1 his head on his breast cried for a while silently whilst we stood
      1 his head as he said
      1 his hand warningly Nay friend Jonathan he said in this the
      1 his hand to the table and said
      1 his hands wringing them in plaintive supplication and poured forth a
      1 his hand on my arm and said
      1 his hand I had convinced them that evil eye or no evil eye the
      1 his hand He had his papers a reet an glad I was to be rid o the
      1 his hand from hers as he spoke
      1 his hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarsely
      1 his hair and asked
      1 His good pleasure and that we ascend to His bidding as that other
      1 his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land who when he was
      1 His finger and thumb closed on her pulse as I thought instinctively and
      1 His face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognised
      1 his face was sterner than ever Some change had come over her body
      1 His face was a stronga very strongaquiline with high bridge of the
      1 his face convulsed with fear Save me save me he cried and then
      1 his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur I could hear my own
      1 his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement To
      1 his existence in his rooms or when he was gloated with fresh blood in
      1 his exclamation of horror Gott in Himmel needed no enforcement from
      1 his ends The Professor stood up
      1 his elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullen
      1 his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered and again he
      1 his doom I trust
      1 his do not lightly die away We should have written long ago but we
      1 his danger in good time With strength and determination like his he
      1 his credentials and so our merchant friend will have done his part
      1 his breakfast from or maybe hes got down some area and is in a
      1 his attention At first he made no reply but at length said testily
      1 his arm to designate what to a vampire was hometheir face show what
      1 his arms and folded her to his breast and for a while she lay there
      1 his arms again as though appealing to the whole universe God God
      1 his and turned it overit does make a pretty good pilehe said
      1 his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way
      1 his agonised face He raised his hand and pointed to the bed and his
      1 hinges lest some illintent or illchance should close them so that
      1 hinderin him This mixture of simplicity and cunning of superstition
      1 him without further trouble
      1 him without an instants delay The man ran off and within a few
      1 him with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him instantly
      1 him with a look of utmost intensity his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
      1 him who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
      1 him what it was and he said with a sort of rapture in his voice and
      1 him what dates I should put on the letters He calculated a minute and
      1 him we know already of its peace or the cutoff head that giveth rest
      1 him to the point of his madnessa thing which I avoid with the patients
      1 him to receive if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs a box
      1 him to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know But he is
      1 him to grow as to his brain for it all prove to him how right he was at
      1 him through the stable we moved toward the hall
      1 him They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
      1 him then we can act for good all round and send him peace My mind is
      1 him Then it is well Now Madam Mina you are in any case quite safe
      1 him Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task He
      1 himthe more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
      1 him the ground to start from to do more Dos pou sto said
      1 him that he doesnt want no Frenchmenwith bloom upon them and also
      1 him so that he swooned into a sort of coma
      1 him so that he could not see them but where they could hear better
      1 him so I suppose he isnt above trying to use a respectable lunatic He
      1 him so I had to see them It was to me a painful meeting for it
      1 him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score the other
      1 himself were from the first some great qualities In a hard and warlike
      1 himself though he come to you in pain or in joy by the day or the
      1 himself the door to the octagonal room and I entered my bedroom
      1 himself saying that he would watch this night and the next and would

      1 himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by
      1 himself in readiness to attack Issue was joined in an instant
      1 himself if I turn the conversation that way I must be very careful

      1 himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs Harker tripped into
      1 himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive

      1 him rest whilst I drive I shall tell him that we have days before us
      1 him on the typewriter at which also I am practising very hard He
      1 him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for
      1 him may suspect for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
      1 him I thought I had best meet him on his own ground so I said
      1 him in the stream where he perish This he knows and will not Now men
      1 him I have asked him to come at once I shall see Miss Westenra
      1 him I had written asking him if he had heard and he said the enclosed
      1 him His bundle of names links all our little band of men together but
      1 him He will be away all day till late for he said he could not lunch
      1 him He stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged in

      1 him dressed in his room His door was ajar so that he could hear the
      1 him by day on the water our task will be over He has a start but he
      1 him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
      1 him be troubled or worried with it at all If ever Jonathan quite gets
      1 him at once as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me
      1 him as on the other night and then to home Coming close to Arthur
      1 him asleep twice when I awoke but I did not fear to go to sleep again
      1 him and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration for
      1 him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well of

      1 He was there too He must a started off and got there afore me for
      1 he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly I asked him
      1 he was officially interestedof so great a tragedy was an

      1 he was in life a most wonderful man Soldier statesman and
      1 He was in fact commanding destinysubjectively He did not really
      1 He was in a panic of superstitious fear and I am afraid the panic may

      1 He was a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little partin which
      1 he wants to talk

      1 he used then to tell me the thing so that I could have the object of
      1 he used long ago to do at lectures and said The good husbandman tell
      1 he understood lately for sale These words put a different complexion
      1 He turned to me and said with grave solemnity
      1 He turned the handle as he spoke but the door did not yield We threw

      1 he tumbled into the flagged area below Through the sound of the

      1 He took it and his eyes glistened You are so good he said And may
      1 he too is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
      1 He told them what Mina had said and went on

      1 He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and placed his

      1 He saw my hesitation and spoke
      1 he saw me he held it out to me and said
      1 he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro We heard his exclamation
      1 he sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity There was
      1 he said You are a man and it is a man we want You are better than
      1 he said to Van Helsing
      1 He said the latter words through his shut teeth For a space of perhaps
      1 He said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in his

      1 her wishes Of course we had then no alternative but to accept We were
      1 her way to Varna Lord Godalming has just returned He had four
      1 her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me Raising his hand to
      1 her Van Helsing would I know do anything for me for a personal
      1 her to reduce sail in face of her danger Before the night shut down she
      1 her There must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one Come
      1 her The Professor has a strongly humorous side and I could from old
      1 her that my old master Van Helsing the great specialist was coming to
      1 her That is the reason of his coming it is concerning Lucy and her
      1 her teeth very carefully whilst she is in the hypnotic condition for
      1 her teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck Then the
      1 hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again She was
      1 her sleep the last week but there is an odd concentration about her
      1 her sleep Her mother has spoken to me about it and we have decided
      1 her She and I were like sisters and now she is gone will you not let
      1 herself I must wake him He dipped the end of a towel in cold water
      1 herself have chosen had it been to her to choose Tell me if there be
      1 herself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of the
      1 herself at home in Exeter Oh but I am sleepy
      1 herself
      1 her rugs I got ready food but she would not eat simply saying that
      1 her room to see for ourselves She was breathing naturally and looked so
      1 her room She was sleeping soundlyso soundly that even my coming did
      1 her room But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly and
      1 her own where a cozy fire was burning Now she said you must stay
      1 her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream But the
      1 heroh did usewas empty What am I to do what am I to do I am back
      1 her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
      1 her nerves received the pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her that
      1 her needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
      1 her mother might be buried together I attended to all the ghastly
      1 Hermanstadt where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due In the
      1 her looks she is a trifle stouter and her cheeks are a lovely
      1 her lips and cheeks and chin from her throat trickled a thin stream of
      1 her life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity True that
      1 her last Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full
      1 her in the night and what with his gorge and the vein left open there
      1 her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat I noticed
      1 her imagination is beginning to work Whilst she has been in the trance
      1 Her I had not dare to take into this place but left safe from the
      1 her I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door
      1 her I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour and I am entering

      1 her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining

      1 her husbands arm and held it tight as though her clinging could
      1 Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
      1 Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his arms
      1 her heart is weakening At any time even now a sudden shock would be

      1 her face was at its worst for the open mouth showed the pale gums Her
      1 her face that I could not quite make out so I said nothing but

      1 he never can be sure and that is the worst of all And he will

      1 For several minutes no one spoke a word The silence was broken by
      1 for seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted

      1 for I have tell them He our enemy have gone away he have gone back
      1 for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
      1 for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air
      1 for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same This startled me but
      1 for I can remember nothing but I am full of vague fear and I feel so
      1 for his soul Oh hear me hear me Let me go let me go let me go
      1 for his is the second watch Now that my work is done I too shall go
      1 for his departure and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street I

      1 for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in

      1 Forgive me Doctor I forgot myself You do not need any help I am so

      1 And yet there is cause there is always cause for everything I must go

      1 and with the eyes of a very happy wife whither duty has led me so that
      1 and with shorter pauses as the time moved on It was apparent that she
      1 and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls Lucy was
      1 and with myself for coming I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
      1 and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider The soft
      1 and with it began to flick him on the face his wife all the while
      1 and with his face almost touching Lucys examined her carefully He
      1 And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me
      1 and will know in full before long what it is to cross my path They
      1 and will heed Moreover these are only to prevent her coming out they

      1 And why with Enoch
      1 and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
      1 and who are in such deadly peril As for me I am not worthy in His

      1 And what is that friend John
      1 And what do you make of it
      1 and went on But you and I shall show them how wrong they are How can
      1 and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
      1 and we have reason to be content with our first nights work It may be
      1 and we find it thank God unharmed amongst the graves Yesterday I came
      1 and we are well supplied with money We have only to make sure that the
      1 and we are soon off We ride to death of some one God alone knows who
      1 and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one
      1 and watched him go into his room and close the door As I stood without
      1 and was just beginning to shave Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder
      1 and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred
      1 and warm and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
      1 and wanted to marry her but although thats all past and gone I cant

      1 and tried to find any sign of life but in vain He could not have lain
      1 and treated us accordingly We saw in this a way of smoothing matters
      1 and tower in front We both seem in good spirits I think we make an

      1 And to our bitter grief with a smile and in silence he died a
      1 And tonight I shall not fear to sleep since he is close at hand and
      1 and told me all about Arthur I told her how anxious I was about
      1 and to go slow Festina lente may well be his motto
      1 and to bring him home Mr Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if
      1 and till sunset he may not change It will take him time to arrive
      1 and thumb and before I knew what he was going to do put it in his
      1 and thrust last nights Westminster Gazette into my hand
      1 and though the sun was bright and the air clear and fresh the big
      1 and those you love There are darknesses in life and there are lights
      1 and this power to good of you and others as you have won from your
      1 and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when youve told me
      1 and thisand he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
      1 and thinking too of how such a story might become distortednay
      1 and they all laughed And my gog how could they be otherwise Look at
      1 and the wind a tempest No sleep for any one Men all worn out Hardly
      1 and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder than
      1 and the servants there one or two old friends of his from Exeter his
      1 and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
      1 and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems
      1 and there is nought in common They are devils of the Pit
      1 and there is a strange excitement in the air It may be our own
      1 and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
      1 And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose Shall I go
      1 and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one
      1 and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldnt come hout the ole
      1 And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less and the
      1 and then there was a sort of agonising feeling as if I were in an
      1      and then So I came away I mistrust these quiet moods of his so
      1 and then please God all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
      1 And then Lucys breathing became stertorous again and all at once it
      1 And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in
      1 and then I must go back to deathor worse Wet my lips with brandy
      1 And then He took a key from his pocket and held it up And then we
      1 and then go back to her own bed As she lay there in my arms and I in
      1 and then for the sake of humanity This monster has done much harm
      1 And then away for home away to the quickest and nearest train away
      1 and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them I
      1 and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
      1 and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there
      1 and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
      1 And the flies I said
      1 and the edges looked fresher that was all We asked Vincent to what he
      1 and the destroying shall be in time sure Here I started up for I
      1 and the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxes
      1 and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying
      1 And the assurance
      1 and that truly I began a new record So it will be until the Great
      1 and that she was his wife in the sight of God None of us said a word of
      1 and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff where
      1 and that I could not make any one in the house hear me He paused and
      1 and that as it was all the strength we could muster was required to
      1 and terrible troublesthat may be more great than you can know May it
      1 and terrible case we can only do as we deem best What else have we to
      1 and teeth so white and eyes that seem to be burning That he be all in
      1 and teach and feedand feedand feed I was not unprepared for this
      1 and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition He is
      1 and taking her hand in his said solemnly
      1 and take counsel together She shuddered and was silent holding down
      1 and sweetly like a little child Her lips are curved and her face beams
      1 and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
      1 and strongly I could hardly speak my heart was so full that even those
      1 and strange to say slept without dreaming Despair has its own calms
      1 and stood silent
      1 and stepped into the passage There was no sign of any one and as there
      1 and Ste Mary He has been under our care for nearly six weeks
      1 and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to
      1 and sprang at us But by this time the Professor had gained his feet
      1 and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking I wish I could put
      1 and speak but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath and he
      1 And so with trust and hope and yet full of fear we go eastward to meet
      1 And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
      1 And so now up to this very hour all the records we have are complete
      1 And so now Art you know all I know I shall keep stern watch I trust
      1 And so my dear Madam Mina it is that we have to rest for a time for
      1 and some of them speak of you so I know you since some days from the
      1 and so learn that which even I myself do not know Dr Van Helsing said
      1 And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of
      1 And so I have written it whilst we wait their return and Mrs Harker
      1 and so I had a good view of him His face was not a good face it was
      1 and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point
      1 And so for full half a minute which seemed an eternity she remained
      1 and so emboldened to proceed in his task Are you satisfied now friend
      1 and smile You have told me all about Lucy and so now we shall not
      1 and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
      1 and sleepy and pale and far from well I determined not to wake her
      1 and sleep with me so she came into bed and lay down beside me she did
      1         And sleeping when she died
      1 and showed a red mark on her throat Arthur did not notice it but I
      1 and shook it off This was repeated several times with greater effort
      1 and she was full of a happy vivacity but I could see evidences of the
      1 and seeing where she was shuddered she gave a loud cry and put her
      1 and seeing them pointing to my window said something at which they
      1 and secure the key the same as before though I do not expect any
      1 and scraping of horses feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard
      1 and say to you Look hes good corn he will make good crop when the
      1 and says that he is just starting for home That is not like Jonathan
      1 and say she would never tell that the ravings of the sick were the
      1 and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak
      1 and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so I became a little more
      1 and sat on the windowsill I have got such a horror of the damned
      1 and said in a soft whisper
      1 and said Go on in a low voice Renfield proceeded
      1 and said
      1 and restore her for now she is all sweet and bright as ever At sunset
      1 and rested silent for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road
      1 Andres April 1854 æt 30 When I came back Mr Swales went on
      1 and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
      1 and red gleaming eyes Lucy did not answer and I ran on to the
      1 and reason so sound I had some work to do which pressed so I told him
      1 and read
      1 and rang as quietly as possible for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
      1 and raised me up and made me sit on the sofa and sat by me he held my
      1 and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
      1 and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them
      1 and putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud dry sobs
      1 and put it down
      1     And prove the very truth he most abhorred
      1 and presently she moved uneasily At the same moment there came a sort
      1 and pointed but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of
      1 and pinched or pricked her with it for byandby when her breathing
      1 and peeped out by the corner of the blind There was a full moonlight
      1 and passages and to try the doors that opened from them One or two
      1 and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement and how
      1 and opportunity go we are prepared for the whole of our journey and
      1 and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air You will be
      1 and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished
      1 and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
      1 and of Asia and Africa too till the peoples thought that the
      1 and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
      1 And now we must settle what we do We have here much data and we must

      1 and night the first time we have been parted since our marriage I do

      1 and nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side I

      1 and in it rests our hope The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
      1 And indeed indeed sir said Arthur warmly I shall in all ways

      1 and he went off at once into a sort of sermon I must try to remember it
      1 and he now got up quietly and went out of the room There was a little
      1 and he listened with seeming impassiveness but his nostrils twitched
      1 and heI fear I am myself the only living soul within the place Let

      1 and give us a fresh start We had a capital severe tea at Robin Hoods
      1 and ghastly pale It was in the bows and looking out I crept behind

      1 and frightened the wits out of us I believe we forgot everything
      1 and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came
      1 and for others and the present will suffice
