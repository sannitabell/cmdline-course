      1 wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again
      1 wonderful Adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and

      1 with the words ‘DRINK ME’ but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
      1 with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with
      1 with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
      1 with such a neck as that No no You’re a serpent and there’s no use
      1 with sobs to sing this
      1 without even waiting to put his shoes on
      1 without attending to her ‘if we had the door between us For instance

      1   While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat
      1 While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing
      1 while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable

      1 ‘Well then’ the Gryphon went on ‘if you don’t know what to uglify is
      1 ‘Well then’ the Cat went on ‘you see a dog growls when it’s angry
      1 ‘Well perhaps your feelings may be different’ said Alice ‘all I know

      1 ‘So he did so he did’ said the Gryphon sighing in his turn and both
      1 so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her
      1 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
